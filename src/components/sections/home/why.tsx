              Frontline conversations happen every day, but almost none of that
              information is captured or analysed. Surveys are slow, reports are
              filtered and often inaccurate, and too many layers sit between the
              ground and decision makers. By the time information arrives,
              it&apos;s outdated.

              Advances in AI now make it possible to understand real on-ground
              conversations at scale. For the first time, organisations can
              access the Ground Truth directly from the field to understand what
              is happening, why it is happening, and where to improve.
